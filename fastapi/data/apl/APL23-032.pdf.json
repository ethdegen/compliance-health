DHCS postponed the planned implementation of the CalAIM initiative, which was originally scheduled for January 1, 2021, due to the COVID-19 public health emergency, and released a revised CalAIM proposal on January 8, 2021. DHCS also submitted its CalAIM Section 1115 Demonstration and 1915(b) Waiver applications to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on June 30, 2021.1 DHCS obtained statutory authority to establish the CalAIM initiative to support the stated goals of identifying and managing the risks and needs of Medi-Cal beneficiaries, transitioning and transforming the Medi-Cal program to a more consistent and seamless system, and improving quality outcomes.2",
