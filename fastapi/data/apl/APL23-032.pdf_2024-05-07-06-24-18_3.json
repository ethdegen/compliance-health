The terms of this risk corridor are set forth in MCPs\u2019 contract with DHCS, and further details of this risk corridor are included in Attachment 2 to this APL. DHCS reserves the right to continue the risk corridor for subsequent rating periods, subject to actuarial judgment and consultation with affected MCPs. If the requirements contained in this APL, including any updates or revisions to this APL and/or ECM Policy Guide, necessitate a change in an MCP\u2019s contractually required policies and procedures (P&Ps), the MCP must submit its updated P&Ps to its Managed Care Operations Division (MCOD) Contract Manager within 90 days of the release of this APL. If an MCP determines that no changes to its P&Ps are necessary, the MCP must submit an email confirmation to its MCOD Contract Manager within 90 days of the release of this APL, stating that the MCP\u2019s P&Ps have been reviewed and no changes are necessary. The email confirmation must include the title of this APL as well as the applicable APL release date in the subject line. MCPs are further responsible for ensuring that their Subcontractors and Network Providers comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations, ECM requirements, contract requirements, and other DHCS guidance, including APLs and Policy Letters. These requirements must be communicated by each MCP to all Subcontractors and Network Providers. DHCS may impose Corrective Action Plans (CAP), as well as administrative and/or monetary sanctions for non-compliance. For additional information regarding administrative and monetary sanctions, see APL 23- 012, and any subsequent iterations on this topic. Any failure to meet the requirements of this APL may result in a CAP and subsequent sanctions.

        "heading": "Enhanced Care Management Risk Corridor Methodology Attachment 2",
        "text": "Scope\nA risk corridor shall be in effect for applicable ECM revenues and expenses for the CY 2022, 2023 and 2024 rating periods. For each MCP, the risk corridor calculation will be performed at the MCP level (statewide) across all counties or rating regions in which the MCP operates, and across all population groups eligible for ECM. The risk corridor does not apply to the following programs:\n\u2022 Dental Managed Care;\n\u2022 Family Mosaic Project;\n\u2022 Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly;\n\u2022 SCAN Health Plan; and\n\u2022 Cal MediConnect (program ended December 31, 2022).\nStructure\nBasis The basis of the risk corridor will be a Gross Medical Expense (GME) calculation. The risk corridor calculation will compare allowable medical expenses as described in the \u2018Expenses (Numerator)\u2019 section to associated revenues as described in the \u2018Revenues (Denominator)\u2019 section, producing a GME expenditure percentage.\nCenter-Point and Gain/Loss Bands The center-point of the risk corridor calculation will be a GME expenditure percentage of 100 percent. MCPs will be fully at risk for gains and losses within 5 percent of the center-point, i.e., from 95 to 105 percent. Gains or losses exceeding 5 percent will be subject to zero MCP risk. Therefore, MCPs will owe a remittance to the State or be owed a payment from the State only if the MCP\u2019s gains or losses exceed 5 percent.\nAdministrative Expenses and Federal and State Taxes and Licensing and Regulatory Fees The risk corridor calculation will not consider administrative expenses including but not limited to federal and state taxes or licensing and regulatory fees. Revenues and expenses associated with these costs will be excluded from the denominator and numerator, respectively, of the calculation.\nRevenues and Expenses\nRevenues (Denominator) The revenues used for the denominator of the GME calculation will be equal to member months multiplied by the sum, on a per-member-per-month (PMPM) basis, of the targeted GME component of the ECM add-on rate (inclusive of outreach). The GME PMPM will be determined by accounting for the targeted percentage of the ECM add-on rate that is attributable to GME through the rate development process. Applicable revenues will be net of administration and underwriting gain loading.\nCalAIM Incentive Payment Program (IPP) revenues that the MCP earns based on performance on ECM-related delivery system infrastructure and provider capacity measures under IPP will be excluded from the denominator.\nExpenses (Numerator) The State will require MCPs to provide and certify allowable medical expense data for ECM services (including outreach) necessary for the risk corridor calculation no sooner than 12 months after the end of the rating period.\nTraditional pay-for-performance payments to ECM providers that are linked to utilization of services may be reported as medical expense and will be subject to review by the State in accordance with the review process described in the \u2018State Review\u2019 section.\nExcluded Expenses The State will reduce, adjust, or exclude expenses, as appropriate, for:\n\u2022 Non-medical expenses, e.g., non-service investments for delivery system infrastructure and provider capacity.\n\u2022 Incurred but not reported expenses that cannot be adequately supported.\n\u2022 Medical expenses for non-ECM services and populations, including but not limited to expenses for Community Supports services, expenses for members who are not within ECM Populations of Focus, or that do not meet phase-in criteria.\n\u2022 Outlier levels of medical expenses\u2014in comparison to other health plan(s) in the county or other counties\u2014for which the MCP does not provide satisfactory justification based on member mix, utilizer acuity, unique network considerations and/or other factors.\n\u2022 Related party expense levels in excess of unrelated party expense levels.\nMCP-Delivered ECM Services\nMCP-Delivered ECM Services Allowable medical expenses may include appropriate expenses for ECM services delivered directly by the MCP, so long as DHCS has previously authorized the MCP\u2019s use of their own staff to deliver ECM services as required in the ECM contract and Model of Care requirements.\nSub-Capitation Expenses In addition to the exclusions described in the \u2018Excluded Expenses\u2019 section all sub- capitation expenses reported as part of the GME calculation will be subject to the following: reduced in recognition of an assumed non-medical component of these payments. Reductions will be applied in a manner that ensures alignment between allowable medical expenses and medical costs considered in the rate development process. Therefore, a 7% reduction will be applied to global sub- capitation payments in CY 2022, an 8% reduction will be applied in CY 2023, and a 9.5% reduction will be applied in CY 2024, except when a lower percentage was assumed in the rate development process.\n\u2022 Non-global sub-capitation payments made by MCPs to a non-global subcontractor or network provider will be considered allowable medical expenses excluding separate and distinct payments that are exclusively for administrative costs as defined in Title 28, California Code of Regulations, \u00a7 1300.78, such as but not limited to network development and claims processing.\nOther Expense Items The State reserves the right to make other appropriate adjustments to MCP-reported expense items that are identified during the State\u2019s review of each MCP\u2019s reported data. Prior to initiating the risk corridor calculations, the State will develop a detailed reporting template and instructions that will provide additional guidance regarding the inclusion or exclusion of other expense types. The State\u2019s review process will include the opportunity for MCPs to discuss with the State any adjustments identified by the State, and to provide additional information or data to support reported expenses, before the State issues a final determination.\nState Review Following the collection of MCP-reported expense data, which will be initiated by the State no sooner than January 1, 2024 for the CY 2022 rating period, no sooner than January 1, 2025 for the CY 2023 rating period and no sooner than January 1, 2026 for the CY 2024 rating period, the State will perform a desk review of each MCP\u2019s reported data, to evaluate compliance with risk corridor definitions, exclusions, and other parameters that will be outlined in the reporting template and instructions. The review will follow a robust process that will be finalized in consultation with its contracted actuarial firm prior to initiating the risk corridor calculations.",
