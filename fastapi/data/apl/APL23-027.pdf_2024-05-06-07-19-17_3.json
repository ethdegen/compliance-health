Benefits Requirements\nEffective January 1, 2024, MCPs in all counties must authorize and cover Medically Necessary adult and pediatric subacute care services (provided in both freestanding and hospital-based facilities). MCPs must determine Medical Necessity consistent with definitions in 22 Code of California Regulations (CCR) sections 51124.5 and 51124.6, Welfare and Institutions\n1. Subacute Care Services Benefits Requirements\nCode (W&I) section 14132.25, and the Medi-Cal Manual of Criteria. Additionally, Members who are admitted into a Subacute Care Facility will remain enrolled in Medi-Cal managed care instead of being disenrolled to Medi-Cal FFS. All MCPs must ensure that Members in need of adult or pediatric subacute care services are placed in a health care facility that provides the level of care most appropriate to the Member's medical needs, as outlined in the MCP Contract and as documented by the Member\u2019s Provider(s). MCPs must ensure that if a Member needs adult or pediatric subacute care services, they are placed in a health care facility that is under contract for subacute care with DHCS\u2019 Subacute Contracting Unit (SCU) or is actively in the process of applying for a contract with DHCS\u2019 SCU.\n2. Other Benefits Requirements for Residents of Subacute Care Facilities\nConsistent with guidance in APL 22-012, Governor\u2019s Executive Order N-01- 19, Regarding Transitioning Medi-Cal Pharmacy Benefits from Managed Care to Medi-Cal Rx, or any superseding APL, the financial responsibility for prescription drugs is determined by the claim type on which they are billed. If certain drugs are dispensed by a pharmacy and billed on a pharmacy claim, they are carved out and paid by Medi-Cal Rx. If the drugs are provided by the Subacute Care Facility and billed on a medical or institutional claim, including physician administered drugs, the MCP is responsible. For MCPs newly covering adult and pediatric subacute care services effective January 1, 2024, financial responsibility for prescription drugs is determined by claim type, as discussed above, since the Medi-Cal FFS Subacute Care Facility per diem rate does not include legend drugs (prescription drugs). MCPs may choose to cover drugs not covered by Medi-Cal Rx, inclusive of over-the-counter drugs and other therapies otherwise not covered by Medi-Cal.",

DHCS will issue Subacute Care Facility Network Readiness Requirements guidance to MCPs. DHCS will also issue MCPs a reporting template with a list of approved and active Subacute Care Facilities to assist with Network readiness and to provide contracting options for MCPs to develop Subacute Care Facility Networks. MCPs may instruct non-DHCS contracted Subacute Care Facilities that they must contract with DHCS or be actively in the process of applying for a Medi-Cal Subacute Care Facility contract in order to receive payment. A list of approved and active Subacute Care Facilities can be found on the DHCS SCU website.20\nMCPs must develop sufficient Network capacity to enable timely Member placement in Subacute Care Facilities within 5 business days, 7 business days, or 14 calendar days of a request, depending on the county of residence, as outlined in W&I section 14197(d).21 A Letter of Agreement does not constitute a Network Provider Agreement.22\nMCPs must make every effort to assess the various provider types currently serving Members residing in Subacute Care Facilities and maintain an adequate Network with them to ensure care is not disrupted and Members receive timely care.

Automatic continuity of care means that if the Member is currently residing in a Subacute Care Facility, they do not have to request continuity of care to continue to reside in that facility. While Members must meet Medical Necessity criteria for adult or pediatric subacute care services, MCPs must automatically ensure the provision of continuity of care. MCPs must allow Members to stay in the same Subacute Care Facility under continuity of care if all of the following apply: \u2022 The facility is contracted or actively in the process of being contracted by DHCS\u2019 SCU; The facility is licensed by CDPH; \u2022 The facility is enrolled as a Medi-Cal Provider; \u2022 The Subacute Care Facility and MCP agree to payment rates; and \u2022 The facility meets the MCP\u2019s applicable professional standards and has no disqualifying quality-of-care issues.27 MCPs must determine if Members are eligible for automatic continuity of care before the transition from Medi-Cal FFS to Medi-Cal managed care by identifying the Member\u2019s Subacute Care Facility residency and pre-existing relationship through historical utilization data or documentation provided by DHCS, such as Medi-Cal FFS utilization data, or by using information from the Member or Provider. A pre-existing relationship means that the Member has resided in the Subacute Care Facility at some point during the 12 months prior to the date of the Member\u2019s enrollment in the MCP. Following their initial 12-month automatic continuity of care period, Members may request an additional 12 months of continuity of care pursuant to the process established by APL 23-022, Continuity of Care for Medi-Cal Beneficiaries Who Newly Enroll in Medi-Cal Managed Care from Medi-Cal Fee-for-Service, on or After January 1, 2023, or any superseding APL. A Member residing in a Subacute Care Facility who newly enrolls in an MCP on or after July 1, 2024, does not receive automatic continuity of care and must instead request continuity of care, following the process established by APL 23-022, or any superseding APL. Pursuant to APL 23-022, or any superseding APL, MCPs must notify the Member or their authorized representative of the Member\u2019s right to request continuity of care and furnish a copy of the notification to the Subacute Care Facility in which the Member resides. If a Member is unable to access continuity of care as requested, the MCP must provide the Member or their authorized representative with a written Notice of Action of an adverse benefit determination in accordance with APL 21-011, Grievance and Appeals Requirements, Notice and \u201cYour Rights\u201d Templates, or any superseding APL. A copy of the notification must also be provided to the Subacute Care Facility in which the Member resides.

MCPs and their assigned care managers must ensure Member transitions to and from a Subacute Care Facility are timely and do not delay or interrupt any Medically Necessary services or care, and that TCS are completed. Effective January 1, 2024, MCPs must ensure all TCS are completed for all Members.\nCare management beyond transitions consists of two programs: (1) Complex Care Management (CCM) and (2) Enhanced Care Management (ECM). If a Member is enrolled in either CCM or ECM, TCS must be provided by the Member\u2019s assigned care manager. MCPs must also continue to provide all elements of BPHM to Members enrolled in care management programs.\nCCM is a service for Medi-Cal managed care Members who need extra support to avoid adverse outcomes but who are not in the highest risk group. CCM provides both ongoing chronic care coordination and interventions for episodic, temporary needs with a goal of regaining optimum health or improved functional capability, in the right setting and in a cost-effective manner.\nECM is a whole-person, interdisciplinary approach to comprehensive care management for Medi-Cal managed care Members who meet the Populations of Focus criteria. It is intended to address the clinical and non-clinical needs of high-cost, high-need Members through systematic coordination of services and it is community-based, interdisciplinary, high-touch, and person-centered. Members residing in Subacute Care Facilities are excluded from receiving ECM during their stay on the basis that the care they are receiving in the Subacute Care Facilities is comprehensive and highly specialized.\nCommunity Supports are medically appropriate and cost-effective alternatives to traditional medical services or settings that are designed to address Social Drivers of Health. MCPs are strongly encouraged to offer Community Supports services to all Members who meet applicable criteria. All MCPs are encouraged to offer as many as possible of the Community Supports approved by DHCS.\nFor more information about PHM, please refer to the DHCS PHM website47; the PHM Policy Guide; APL 22-024, or any superseding APL; and the operative MCP Contract (as amended). For more information about ECM or Community Supports, please refer to the DHCS ECM and Community Supports website48; APL 21-012, or any superseding APL; APL 21-017, or any superseding APL; the Finalized ECM and Community Supports MCP Contract Template49; the ECM Policy Guide50; and the Community Supports Policy Guide.51",
