        "text": "QUALITY AND HEALTH EQUITY TEAMS & DESIGNATED CONTACTS MCPs are required to have at minimum, the teams below to lead the quality and health equity efforts across their organization:\n\u2022 Performance Improvement Lead: MCPs must designate a performance measurement lead and at least one designated backup contact to report performance measurements to DHCS. The performance measurement lead acts as a liaison to communicate DHCS requirements to MCPs and coordinate MCPs\u2019 satisfactory and timely completion of required quality improvement (QI) submissions. In the absence of the performance measurement lead, the backup contact must be familiar with the performance measures to assume the duties of the performance measurement lead.\n\u2022 Regional Quality and Health Equity Teams: MCPs must develop or leverage existing regional quality and health equity teams to support the QI and health equity work for all their counties across various DHCS designated regions. MCP regional teams are expected to develop partnerships within their designated regions that include at a minimum, Network Providers, partner MCPs, county Behavioral Health Plans (BHP), local health departments, community-based organizations (CBOs), local governmental agencies (e.g., department/county of social services, Women, Infant, and Children agencies, child welfare departments), regional centers, home and community-based service programs, continuum of care programs, First 5 programs, Area Agencies of Aging, caregiver resource centers, local education agencies, Individual Family Service Plans, and Members. The regional teams must participate in state-driven collaborative meetings and projects to improve partnerships in these regions.\nQUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND HEALTH EQUITY TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS MCPs are required to implement and annually report a QIHETP plan that addresses clinical quality of physical, behavioral health, access and engagement of providers, continuity and coordination across settings and all levels of care, and Member experience. DHCS updates the Medi-Cal Managed Care Accountability Set: Quality Improvement and Health Equity Framework Policy Guide as needed to reflect the evolving QI and health equity improvement projects that MCPs are required to do as well as QIHETP deliverable requirements. The Quality Improvement and Health Equity Framework is based on a regional approach and encompasses geographical variations to health outcomes and health-related social needs.\nCalculating and Reporting Rates: Each MCP calculates its rates for the required MCAS measures, and these rates are audited by the External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) and reported as determined by DHCS. Each MCP must report to the EQRO the results of each of the MCAS measures required of that MCP and their Fully Delegated Subcontractors and Downstream Fully Delegated Subcontractors while adhering to the requirements set forth by HEDIS\u00ae, CMS, or other applicable technical specifications for the MY. MCPs must follow DHCS\u2019 and the NCQA\u2019s timeline for collecting, calculating, and reporting rates. MCPs must calculate and report performance measure rates as determined by DHCS. MCPs will be held to the MPL at the county or approved combined reporting level as approved by DHCS. A new MCP or an existing MCP expanding its operations into a new county must begin to report its MCAS performance measure rates during the first reporting cycle, as determined by DHCS and the EQRO.\no MCPs/SHPs are required to use DHCS\u2019 EQRO File Transfer Protocol (FTP) website when sending communications containing patient-level data. To establish additional user profiles or remove previous users for FTP access, MCPs/SHPs may contact the EQRO.\nMCPs must exceed the MPL as determined by DHCS. The MPL for a majority of the MCAS measures is the national Medicaid 50th percentile for each measure; however, when national Medicaid results are not available for a required MCAS measure, DHCS may establish alternative benchmarks. DHCS has also established High Performance Levels (HPLs) for MCPs. MCPs are encouraged to meet or exceed HPLs for performance measures. While meeting the HPL is not a requirement, DHCS establishes a HPL for each required MCAS performance measure that is also a NCQA measure and publicly acknowledges MCPs that meet or exceed the HPLs. The current HPL is the national Medicaid",

MCPs that perform below DHCS\u2019 established MPLs are also subject to enforcement actions as specified in APL 23-012, including subsequent updates. For HEDIS measures, the MPL benchmarks are established by NCQA and released in the fall of each MY, and the respective NCQA Product Year is used to compare the same MY (e.g. MY 2022 HEDIS measures are compared to NCQA\u2019s Product Year 2022 benchmarks). For CMS Core Set measures, the MPL for the current MY is compared to the previous Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) benchmarks (e.g. MY 2022 CMS Core set measures are compared to CMS\u2019s FFY 2021 benchmarks).\n\u2022 Audit Requirements:\nMCPs must participate in an annual performance measure validation audit performed by DHCS' EQRO. The audit consists of an assessment of the MCP\u2019s and its Fully Delegated Subcontractors\u2019 and Downstream Fully Delegated Subcontractors\u2019 information system capability, followed by an evaluation of the MCP\u2019s ability to comply with specifications outlined by DHCS for HEDIS\u00ae and non-HEDIS\u00ae measures. The EQRO follows the NCQA HEDIS\u00ae Compliance Audit\u2122 methodology to assure standardized reporting of quality performance measures throughout the health care industry. MCPs must use DHCS\u2019 EQRO for conducting the performance measure validation. While the EQRO is responsible for performing the performance measurement validation audits, the EQRO may subcontract with independent auditors licensed by the NCQA to conduct some of the audits. MCPs are required to submit patient-level data as specified by the EQRO as part of the performance measurement audit process.",

Health Equity Promotion: MCPs are required to align their health equity goals with DHCS\u2019 Health Equity Framework within the Comprehensive Quality Strategy (CQS) Report. Additionally, MCPs are required to stratify DHCS-selected MCAS measures by various demographics including, but not limited to age, gender, race/ethnicity, and primary language, for which the MCAS is updated annually to reflect the desired measures to be stratified and by which demographics and categorizations. For these selected MCAS measure demographic stratifications, DHCS may hold MCPs accountable for reaching a designated benchmark at the county or approved combined reporting level. DHCS sets targets for MCPs to achieve and close the gap in rate performance to the established benchmarks. MCPs are required to incorporate their county or region-specific Population Needs Assessment, as detailed in the Population Health Management Policy Guide, build community partnerships, and improve Member participation to fully understand the barriers preventing all populations from receiving care and preventive services as well as social drivers of health.
