        "text": "Street Medicine Provider as a Member\u2019s Assigned PCP Street medicine provider refers to a licensed medical provider (e.g., Doctor of Medicine (MD)/Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), Physician Assistant (PA), Nurse Practitioner (NP), Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM)) who conducts patient visits outside of the four walls of clinics or hospitals and directly on the street, in environments where unsheltered individuals may be (such as those living in a car, RV, abandoned building, or other outdoor areas). For a non-physician medical practitioner (PA, NP, and CNM), MCPs must ensure compliance with state law and Contract requirements regarding physician supervision of non-physician medical practitioners.2 Additionally, given the unique and specialized nature of street medicine, a supervising Physician must be a practicing street medicine provider, with knowledge of and experience in street medicine clinical guidelines and protocols. Contracted street medicine Providers may choose to serve as the Member\u2019s assigned PCP upon Member election, similar to how Obstetrician-Gynecologist (OB/GYN) Providers can elect to serve as PCPs. In order to serve as a PCP, the street medicine Provider must meet the MCP\u2019s eligibility criteria for being a PCP, be qualified and capable of treating the full range of health care issues served by PCPs within their scope of practice, and agree to serve in a PCP role. Street medicine Providers, when elected by Members to act as their assigned PCP, are responsible for providing the full array of Primary Care services, including but not limited to, preventive services, and the treatment of acute and chronic conditions. Thus, street medicine Providers who choose to act as a Member\u2019s assigned PCP must agree to provide the essential components of the Medical Home in order to provide comprehensive and continuous medical care, including but not limited to:3 Basic Population Health Management; \u2022 Care coordination and health promotion; \u2022 Support for Members, their families, and their authorized representatives; \u2022 Referral to Specialists, including behavioral health, community, and social support services, when needed; \u2022 The use of Health Information Technology to link services, as feasible and appropriate; and \u2022 Provision of primary and preventative services to assigned Members. If the street medicine Provider does not have the capability to provide Primary Care services on the street, the street medicine Provider must be affiliated with a brick-and- mortar facility (e.g., primary care medical office, Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), clinic, etc.). In this case, MCPs must assign Members to the affiliated brick- and-mortar facility to which the street medicine Provider is affiliated. MCPs may assign their Members to the street medicine Provider as the assigned PCP directly, or to the street medicine Provider\u2019s affiliated brick-and-mortar location, but must make clear the Member\u2019s care is being overseen by a street medicine Provider PCP. If the street medicine Provider is willing to serve in the Member\u2019s assigned PCP capacity, the MCP is responsible for enrolling and credentialing the street medicine Provider, in accordance with APL 22-013: Provider Credentialing/Re-Credentialing and Screening/Enrollment.4 Site Review and Medical Record Review Requirements Street medicine Providers who are serving in an assigned PCP capacity are required to undergo the appropriate level of site review process, which is either a full or a condensed review. \u2022 For street medicine Providers serving as an assigned PCP, and that are affiliated with a brick-and-mortar facility or that operate a mobile unit/RV, the MCP must conduct the full review process of the street medicine Provider and affiliated facility in accordance with APL 22-017: Primary Care Provider Site Reviews: Facility Site Review and Medical Record Review. affiliated with a brick-and-mortar facility or mobile unit/RV, the MCP must conduct a condensed Facility Site Review (FSR) and Medical Record Review (MRR) of the street medicine Provider to ensure Member safety. The requirements for the condensed FSR and MRR that MCPs must adhere to as part of their review processes is forthcoming, and will be limited to FSR and MRR requirements that would apply only to a street medicine Provider under this scenario. The condensed FSR and MRR requirements will be based on and reflective of the full FSR and MRR requirements as outlined in APL 22-017. MCPs that use street medicine Providers as PCPs must develop and maintain protocols for identifying and transferring Members to a higher level of care if needed when the Member\u2019s service needs are beyond the capabilities and/or qualifications of the street medicine Provider. MCPs must ensure protocols include providing access to urgent and emergency care, specialty care, mental health and substance use disorder treatment, ancillary services, and appropriate Non-Emergency Medical and Non-Medical Transportation services. MCPs must also ensure their street medicine protocols allow for expeditious referrals to ECM and Community Supports. Process for Street Medicine Provider to Become Member\u2019s Assigned PCP If an MCP has street medicine Providers willing to serve in a PCP capacity, MCPs must inform Members through the Member Handbook that contracted street medicine Providers may be elected to be the Member\u2019s assigned PCP so that the Member and the street medicine Provider can discuss whether this arrangement is appropriate. Additionally, MCPs may distribute population-specific communications about their street medicine program (pamphlets, brochures, fact sheets, etc.) approved through the DHCS file and use process. Street medicine Providers are advised to assess and examine the level and quality of the establishment of the treatment relationship at the time of initial engagement when considering an agreement to be a Member\u2019s assigned PCP, as DHCS envisions dynamic and exceptional Provider-Member patient interactions. Street medicine Providers should also be committed in ensuring that the Member patient is transferred to another PCP in a timely manner in the event the street medicine Provider is no longer able or willing to serve as the assigned PCP. If the street medicine Provider is willing to be the Member\u2019s assigned PCP, the street medicine Provider must initiate the request via telephone call to the MCP with the Member on the line, and both parties must confirm to the MCP the Member\u2019s choice in selecting the street medicine Provider to be their assigned PCP. DHCS encourages MCPs to establish a streamlined PCP assignment process for street medicine Providers. MCPs must make clear that the street medicine Provider is the Member\u2019s assigned PCP or is overseeing the Member\u2019s care. MCPs must inform street medicine Providers of PCP responsibilities, as well as credentialing and review requirements, as applicable.",

        "heading": "Street Medicine Provider as an ECM Provider",
        "text": "Street Medicine Provider as an ECM Provider ECM is delivered primarily by community-based ECM Providers that enter into contracts with MCPs. MCPs may contract with street medicine Providers to become an ECM Provider. A street medicine Provider can be contracted to provide both PCP and ECM services to a Member. ECM is primarily in-person based, and as such, ECM Providers are poised to build trust and facilitate coordinated care management with individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Street medicine Providers that are also ECM Providers are required to enroll in Medi-Cal if there is a state-level enrollment pathway; fulfill all ECM requirements; have the capacity to provide culturally appropriate and timely in-person care management activities; and have formal agreements, data systems, and processes in place with entities across sectors to support care coordination and care management. Street Medicine Providers Serving Solely as Referring or Treating Contracted Provider The contracted street medicine Provider has the right to decline the additional responsibilities of an assigned PCP, and instead, care for Members in a non-PCP capacity as a referring or treating contracted Provider working with individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness. To provide care in this capacity, street medicine Providers must have processes in place to work with the MCP, the Member\u2019s PCP, and ECM Care Manager to ensure the Member has referrals to primary care, Community Supports, behavioral health services, and other social services as needed. Medi-Cal Eligibility Street medicine Providers are required to verify the Medi-Cal eligibility of individuals they encounter in the provision of health care services. Medi-Cal eligible individuals will be covered by either the Medi-Cal Fee-for-Service (FFS) or Medi-Cal managed care (with a corresponding MCP) delivery system. For those individuals without Medi-Cal coverage, the Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) program is one pathway for qualified HPE Providers to determine Medi-Cal eligibility. HPE provides qualified individuals immediate access to temporary Medi-Cal services while individuals apply for permanent Medi-Cal coverage. DHCS allows qualified HPE Providers to determine presumptive eligibility under the HPE program off the premises of hospitals and clinics, such as in mobile clinics, street teams, or other locations. Billing/Reimbursement Street medicine Providers rendering services to Medi-Cal eligible individuals are to bill Medi-Cal FFS, or the MCP if contracted, based on the eligibility of the individual, for appropriate and applicable services within their scope of practice. If the street medicine Provider is an FQHC, they can still be reimbursed at their applicable Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate when such services are being provided outside the four walls and where the Member is located. The FQHC would be paid their applicable PPS rate when the street medicine Provider is a billable clinic provider. Street medicine Providers can also be reimbursed for providing other State Plan benefits. MCPs are responsible for ensuring non-duplication of services with any other covered benefit, program, and/or delivery system. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) created a new Place of Service (POS) code 27 (Outreach Site/Street) that became effective October 1, 2023. Street medicine providers should bill POS code 27 to Medi-Cal FFS or MCPs when rendering services for street medicine, as defined in this APL, as of October 1, 2023. Please note that DHCS is currently making necessary updates in the California Medicaid Management Information System (CA-MMIS) to accommodate POS code 27, and any FFS claims that are denied for using POS code 27 during CA-MMIS updates do not need to be resubmitted and will be reprocessed automatically once the necessary system changes are fully implemented. A Medi-Cal NewsFlash will be forthcoming to reflect this update. POS codes 04 (Homeless Shelter), 15 (Mobile Unit), and 16 (Temporary Lodging) should continue to be utilized for services provided in those respective settings. DHCS would like to reiterate that both street medicine and mobile medicine are reimbursable services in accordance with billing protocols and a provider\u2019s scope of practice; however, it remains the expectation of DHCS that individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness receive appropriate and applicable services in their lived environment via street medicine.",
