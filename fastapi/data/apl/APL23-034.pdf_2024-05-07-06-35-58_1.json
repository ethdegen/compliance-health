For the purposes of this APL, the AHCSP is Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. referenced henceforth as \u201cKaiser.\u201d AB 118 (Committee on Budget, Chapter 42, Statutes of 2023) authorizes the expansion of the WCM Program no sooner than January 1, 2025. The purpose of the WCM Program is to incorporate CCS covered services into Medi-Cal managed care for CCS-eligible Members.
