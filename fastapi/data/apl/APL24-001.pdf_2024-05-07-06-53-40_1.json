The fundamental approach of street medicine is to engage people experiencing unsheltered homelessness exactly where they are and on their own terms to maximally reduce or eliminate barriers to care access and follow-through.1 Typically, and for the purposes of this APL, street medicine is provided to an individual experiencing unsheltered homelessness in their lived environment, places that are not intended for human habitation. Health care services provided at shelters, mobile units/recreational vehicles (RV), or other sites with a fixed, specified location does not qualify as street medicine, it is considered mobile medicine, as it requires people experiencing unsheltered homelessness to visit a health care provider at the provider\u2019s fixed, specified location. Please note that mobile units/RVs that go to the individual experiencing unsheltered homelessness in their lived environment (\u201con the street\u201d) is considered street medicine.",

Even if the MCP delegates the provision of health care services to a Subcontractor, MCPs have an option to directly contract with street medicine Providers. Direct contracts with street medicine Providers can allow ready access to health care services for individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness and would reduce contracting complexity for street medicine Providers. For example, rather than having to contract with each subcontracted Independent Physician/Provider Association (IPA) in the MCP\u2019s Network, the street medicine Provider could directly contract with the MCP. In addition, the street medicine Provider would be subject to the same MCP administrative processes (e.g., billing protocols, credentialing requirements, authorization guidelines, etc.) rather than multiple processes and requirements under each subcontracting entity. The payment arrangement would be between the MCP and the street medicine Provider. Moreover, Prior Authorization to see a street medicine Provider would not be needed if the Member seeks services directly from a street medicine Provider related to the Member\u2019s primary care. This means that an MCP- contracted street medicine Provider, that meets all MCP-required administrative processes, could provide services to an MCP Member and receive payment for those services, even if the Member is assigned to a Subcontractor, such as a medical group or IPA.",
