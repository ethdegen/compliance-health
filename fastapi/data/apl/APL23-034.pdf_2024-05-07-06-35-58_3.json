        "text": "POLICY: Participating MCPs assume full financial responsibility, with some exceptions, of authorization and payment of CCS-eligible medical services including, but not limited to, service authorization activities, claims processing and payment, case management, and quality oversight. Service authorization activities include Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and referrals arising from the Medical Therapy Conference (MTC), Medical Therapy Program (MTP), and Medical Therapy services that are not otherwise the responsibility of the county\u2019s Medical Therapy Unit (MTU). Under the WCM Program, the MCP, County CCS Program, and DHCS each bear responsibility for various administrative functions to support the CCS Program. Responsibility for the CCS Program\u2019s eligibility functions under the WCM Program is determined by whether the County CCS Program operates as an independent or dependent county. Independent CCS counties maintain responsibility for CCS Program medical eligibility including financial, residential, and initial determinations for referred Members and potential Members, including responding to and tracking appeals relating to CCS Program medical eligibility determinations and annual medical eligibility redeterminations. In dependent counties, DHCS maintains responsibility for CCS Program medical eligibility determinations and redeterminations including responding to and tracking appeals relating to CCS Program medical eligibility determinations and annual medical eligibility redeterminations, while the County CCS Programs maintain responsibility for financial and residential eligibility determinations and re- determinations. MCPs must provide necessary documentation, including but not limited to Medical Records, case notes, and reports pertaining to the CCS-eligible condition to the County CCS Program to assist with initial and annual medical eligibility determinations. For more information on determinations and redeterminations please see the MCP Reporting to County CCS Program section of this APL. MCPs must refer a Member to the county for a CCS eligibility determination if the Member demonstrates a CCS condition(s) as outlined in the CCS Medical Eligibility Guide.

MCP AND COUNTY COORDINATION MCPs and County CCS Programs must coordinate the delivery of CCS services to CCS-eligible Members according to the parameters outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). MCPs are responsible for reviewing offered coverages to prevent duplication of services. To continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the MOU processes, MCPs must review their MOUs annually to determine if any modifications, amendments, updates, or renewals of responsibilities and obligations are needed, including incorporating any applicable contractual requirements and policy guidance into their MOUs. MCPs must also continually update policies, procedures, and protocols, as appropriate, and discuss activities related to the MOU and other WCM related matters as prescribed in the MOU. A. Memorandum of Understanding Participating WCM MCPs and WCM County CCS Programs must execute a MOU that outlines their respective responsibilities and obligations under the WCM Program. The purpose of the WCM MOU is to explain how the MCP and County CCS Program coordinate care, conduct program management activities, and engage in information exchange activities required for the effective and seamless delivery of services to WCM Members. The MOU between the individual county and the MCP must ensure collaboration between the MCP and County CCS Program. Each WCM MOU must include, at a minimum, all the provisions required in the WCM MOU Template posted on the CCS WCM page of the DHCS website. B. Liaison MCPs must designate at least one individual as the primary point of contact responsible for CCS Members\u2019 care coordination who has knowledge of or adequate training on the CCS Program and clinical experience with either the CCS population or pediatric patients with complex medical conditions. CCS Liaisons must receive training on the full spectrum of rules and regulations pertaining to the CCS Program, including referral requirements and processes, annual medical review processes with counties, and care management and authorization processes for CCS children. The liaison can also be a point of contact for Enhanced Care Management (ECM) and Community Supports Providers that serve CCS-eligible Members under the ECM populations of focus. C. Transition Plans To be approved to participate in the WCM Program, MCPs must develop a comprehensive transition plan detailing their collaboration with the County CCS Program on the transition of existing CCS Members into managed care. The transition plan must describe the transfer of case management; care coordination; Provider referrals; and service authorization, including administrative functions, from the County CCS Program to the MCP. The transition plan must also include communication with Members regarding, but not limited to, authorizations, Provider Network, case management, and ensure continuity of care and services for Members who are in the process of aging out of CCS. The County CCS Programs are required to provide input and collaborate with MCPs on the development of the transition plan. MCPs must submit transition plans to DHCS for approval.",
