Through a federal Medicaid 1115 demonstration waiver approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) is partnering with state agencies, counties, providers, and community-based organizations (CBOs) to establish a coordinated community reentry process that assists people leaving incarceration with connecting to the physical and behavioral health services they need, prior to release and reentering their communities. The goal of the demonstration\u2019s Medi-Cal Justice-Involved Reentry Initiative, is to build a bridge to community-based care for justice-involved Medi-Cal members, offering them services up to 90 days prior to their release to stabilize their health conditions and establish a plan for their community-based care (collectively referred to as \u201cpre-release services\u201d).",

        "text": "POLICY: On October 20, 2023, DHCS released the Guide that provides detailed policy requirements and operational expectations for implementation of the Medi-Cal Justice-Involved Reentry Initiative. The audience of the Guide includes, but is not limited to, correctional facilities, county behavioral health agencies, county social service departments, Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs), County Mental Health Plans/Drug Medi-Cal and Drug Medi-Cal Organized Delivery Systems, and community-based providers. As implementing partners begin to advance in the process of standing up the Medi-Cal Justice-Involved Reentry Initiative, and as CMS continues to refine its own sub-regulatory guidance for states that receive demonstration approval, it is expected that The Guide will be updated on an ongoing basis to reflect new policy decisions and operational requirements. The following sections are included in the Guide. The bold sections have been emphasized to show the most relevant sections for MCPs. Section 1: Legal Authority \u2022 Section 2: Providing Access and Transforming Health (PATH) Funding \u2022 Section 3: Approach to Planning \u2022 Section 4: Enrolling in Medi-Cal Coverage \u2022 Section 5: Pre-Release Service Readiness Assessments \u2022 Section 6: Pre-Release Services and Eligibility Screening Processes. Section 7: Compliance with Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act \u2022 Section 8: Providing Pre-Release Services Delivery Model \u2022 Section 9: Provider Enrollment and Payment \u2022 Section 10: Pre-Release Service Rate Setting \u2022 Section 11: Reentry Planning \u2022 Section 12: Monitoring and Evaluation \u2022 Section 13: Managed Care Plan Requirements. MCPs are responsible for ensuring that their Subcontractors and Network Providers comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations, Contract requirements, and other DHCS guidance, including APLs, related Policy Guides, and Policy Letters.3 These requirements must be communicated by each MCP to all Subcontractors and Network Providers. DHCS may impose Corrective Action Plans (CAP), as well as administrative and/or monetary sanctions for non-compliance. For additional information regarding administrative and monetary sanctions, see APL 23- 012, and any subsequent updates. Any failure to meet the requirements of this APL may result in a CAP and subsequent sanctions. If you have any questions regarding this APL, please contact your MCOD Contract Manager.",
