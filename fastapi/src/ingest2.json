Subacute Care Services Benefits Requirements\n\nEffective January 1, 2024, MCPs in all counties must authorize and cover Medically Necessary adult and pediatric subacute care services (provided in both freestanding and hospital-based facilities).14 MCPs must determine Medical Necessity consistent with definitions in 22 Code of California Regulations (CCR) sections 51124.5 and 51124.6, Welfare and Institutions\n\nCode (W&I) section 14132.25, and the Medi-Cal Manual of Criteria.15 Additionally, Members who are admitted into a Subacute Care Facility will remain enrolled in Medi-Cal managed care instead of being disenrolled to Medi-Cal FFS. All MCPs must ensure that Members in need of adult or pediatric subacute care services are placed in a health care facility that provides the level of care most appropriate to the Member's medical needs, as outlined in the MCP Contract and as documented by the Member’s Provider(s). MCPs must ensure that if a Member needs adult or pediatric subacute care services, they are placed in a health care facility that is under contract for subacute care with DHCS’ Subacute Contracting Unit (SCU) or is actively in the process of applying for a contract with DHCS’ SCU.\n\n2. Other Benefits Requirements for Residents of Subacute Care Facilities\n\nConsistent with guidance in APL 22-012, Governor’s Executive Order N-01- 19, Regarding Transitioning Medi-Cal Pharmacy Benefits from Managed Care to Medi-Cal Rx, or any superseding APL, the financial responsibility for prescription drugs is determined by the claim type on which they are billed. If certain drugs are dispensed by a pharmacy and billed on a pharmacy claim, they are carved out and paid by Medi-Cal Rx. If the drugs are provided by the Subacute Care Facility and billed on a medical or institutional claim, including physician administered drugs, the MCP is responsible.\n\nFor MCPs newly covering adult and pediatric subacute care services effective January 1, 2024, financial responsibility for prescription drugs is determined by claim type, as discussed above, since the Medi-Cal FFS Subacute Care Facility per diem rate does not include legend drugs (prescription drugs).16 MCPs may choose to cover drugs not covered by Medi-Cal Rx, inclusive of over-the-counter drugs and other therapies otherwise not covered by Medi- Cal.\n\nMCPs must comply with Population Health Management (PHM) requirements as set forth in Part X below, which include the coordination of Medically Necessary drugs or medications on behalf of the Member.17,18\n\nMCPs must cover all Medically Necessary services covered under the MCP Contract for Members residing in or obtaining care in a Subacute Care Facility, including facility services, professional services, and ancillary services. MCPs must also provide the appropriate level of care coordination, including for carved-out Medi-Cal services, as outlined in this APL and in adherence to contractual requirements and the DHCS PHM Policy Guide.19"

Network Readiness Requirements\n\nAs part of readiness, MCPs must offer a contract to all Subacute Care Facilities within the MCP’s service area(s) that have a Subacute Care Contract with DHCS’ SCU or are actively in the process of applying for a Medi-Cal Subacute Care Contract and are enrolled in Medi-Cal. These requirements ensure MCPs meet and maintain Subacute Care Facility Network Readiness Requirements and standards and Members currently residing in a Subacute Care Facility do not experience disruptions in access to care. DHCS will issue Subacute Care Facility Network Readiness Requirements guidance to MCPs. DHCS will also issue MCPs a reporting template with a list of approved and active Subacute Care Facilities to assist with Network readiness and to provide contracting options for MCPs to develop Subacute Care Facility Networks. MCPs may instruct non-DHCS contracted Subacute Care Facilities that they must contract with DHCS or be actively in the process of applying for a Medi-Cal Subacute Care Facility contract in order to receive payment. A list of approved and active Subacute Care Facilities can be found on the DHCS SCU website.20\n\nMCPs must develop sufficient Network capacity to enable timely Member placement in Subacute Care Facilities within 5 business days, 7 business days, or 14 calendar days\n\nof a request, depending on the county of residence, as outlined in W&I section 14197(d).21 A Letter of Agreement does not constitute a Network Provider Agreement.22\n\nMCPs must make every effort to assess the various provider types currently serving Members residing in Subacute Care Facilities and maintain an adequate Network with them to ensure care is not disrupted and Members receive timely care. For example, when Medically Necessary, it is the MCP’s responsibility to cover a Member’s transportation to dialysis, as well as dialysis services provided outside the Subacute Care Facility.\n\nIn accordance with APL 21-003, Medi-Cal Network Provider and Subcontractor Terminations, or any superseding APL, MCPs must comply with requirements relating to California Department of Public Health (CDPH)-initiated facility de-certifications and suspensions to ensure that impacted Members have appropriate transition options and do not experience disruption in access to care.\n\nMCPs must also ensure Members have appropriate transition options and continue to have access to care when there is a Medi-Cal Subacute Care Facility contract termination. MCPs must create policies to ensure no new admissions of Members occur in facilities that have bans of admissions from DHCS’ SCU."

Population Health Management Requirements\n\nIn addition to benefit standardization, effective January 1, 2023, MCPs must implement a PHM Program that ensures all Members, including those using adult or pediatric subacute care services, have access to a comprehensive set of services based on their needs and preferences across the continuum of care, including Basic Population Health Management (BPHM), transitional care services (TCS), care management programs, and Community Supports, as appropriate.\n\nBPHM applies an approach to care that ensures needed programs and services, including primary care, are made available to each Member at the right time and in the right setting. In contrast to care management, which is focused on populations with significant or emerging needs, all MCP Members receive BPHM, regardless of their level of need. BPHM replaces DHCS’ previous “Basic Case Management” requirements.\n\nAs part of their PHM Program, MCPs must provide strengthened TCS that will be implemented in a phased approach. MCPs must ensure that Prior Authorizations are rendered in a timely manner for all Members, and know when all Members are admitted, discharged, or transferred from Subacute Care Facilities. MCPs must also ensure that all TCS are completed for all high-risk Members,46 including assigning a single point of contact, referred to as a care manager, to assist Members throughout their transition and ensure all required services are complete. MCPs and their assigned care managers must ensure Member transitions to and from a Subacute Care Facility are timely and do not delay or interrupt any Medically Necessary services or care, and that TCS are completed. Effective January 1, 2024, MCPs must ensure all TCS are completed for all Members.\n\nCare management beyond transitions consists of two programs: (1) Complex Care Management (CCM) and (2) Enhanced Care Management (ECM). If a Member is enrolled in either CCM or ECM, TCS must be provided by the Member’s assigned care\n\nmanager. MCPs must also continue to provide all elements of BPHM to Members enrolled in care management programs.\n\nCCM is a service for Medi-Cal managed care Members who need extra support to avoid adverse outcomes but who are not in the highest risk group. CCM provides both ongoing chronic care coordination and interventions for episodic, temporary needs with a goal of regaining optimum health or improved functional capability, in the right setting and in a cost-effective manner.\n\nECM is a whole-person, interdisciplinary approach to comprehensive care management for Medi-Cal managed care Members who meet the Populations of Focus criteria. It is intended to address the clinical and non-clinical needs of high-cost, high-need Members through systematic coordination of services and it is community-based, interdisciplinary, high-touch, and person-centered. Members residing in Subacute Care Facilities are excluded from receiving ECM during their stay on the basis that the care they are receiving in the Subacute Care Facilities is comprehensive and highly specialized.\n\nCommunity Supports are medically appropriate and cost-effective alternatives to traditional medical services or settings that are designed to address Social Drivers of Health. MCPs are strongly encouraged to offer Community Supports services to all Members who meet applicable criteria. All MCPs are encouraged to offer as many as possible of the Community Supports approved by DHCS.\n\nFor more information about PHM, please refer to the DHCS PHM website47; the PHM Policy Guide; APL 22-024, or any superseding APL; and the operative MCP Contract (as amended).
